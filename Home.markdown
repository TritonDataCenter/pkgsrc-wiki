# Joyent Packages Documentation

This wiki contains a number of documents for getting up to speed with pkgsrc,
specifically for the platforms supported by Joyent for which binary packages
are made available at [pkgsrc.joyent.com](https://pkgsrc.joyent.com).

The primary reference documentation for pkgsrc is the [pkgsrc
guide](https://www.netbsd.org/docs/pkgsrc/).  The documents here are primarily
for getting set up on our supported platforms, as well as general HOWTO style
guides for common tasks.
